                I bought a plane ticket to Argentina. The culmination of a year long effort had finally crystallized.
                It was real. I was going to spend 7 weeks in a country I could've never dreamed of visiting. I was bursting with
                mixtures of excitement and anxiety. I constantly found myself asking: "What is it going to be like?"
              </p>

              <p>Little did I know that my journey was about to begin with quite a twist.</p>

                After a 26-hour delay, I luckily got on a flight as a standby passenger and arrived in Buenos Aires 10 hours later.
                On arrival, it slowly dawned upon me that there was something amiss. My baggage had been mishandled and was still stuck in Texas.
                This was problematic, as my trip was already off to a bad start with the weather-induced flight delay. I promptly walked up to the baggage claim and expressed my concern in
                Spanish, and immediately realized that I did not understand a single word that was spoken back to me. The accent was so thick, words blended together so seamlessly,
                it was like a cacaophony of barely recognizable Spanish words laden with a heavy Italian accent. I had to ask to speak to someone in English and they promptly filed my claim.
                I hung around the airport waiting for my 5-hour bus ride to Rosario (about 200km away). During this time, I also got to experience my first meal in Argentina: McDonalds.
                And so began the long ride to Rosario.

                I arrived late at night in Rosario with my phone dead and an address of my host family's home. The bus driver assisted me in finding the exact door and made
                sure that I arrived at my destination safely and that someone was home. I met my host mother and we clicked right away. She served me some warm dinner (pastel del carne) with a
                refreshing glass of wine while we conversed about the whole fiasco I had just experienced. My host mother and I developed an incredibly strong bond, and every single night of dinner
                consisted of lively conversations spanning a variety of topics ranging from adversity, love, tragedy, politics, history, consciousness, spirituality, and meditation amongst other things.

                During my stay in Rosario, I met a street musician whose music particularly struck me as evocative. He sang by the riverside
                and happily smiled at every passerby. I approached him, dropped 50 pesos into his guitar case and grabbed his CD. We chatted for
                a few minutes and I went home and popped the CD in while relaxing to some Yerba Mate. Even though I could hardly understand his words,
                something about the music really pulled me in. I decided to like his Facebook music page, and he promptly added me from his personal account.
                A few conversations later, we got along really well. When I returned from Argentina, I was feeling strange for the first few days. He sent me this
                message, which eventually inspired me to create this webpage:

                "That sensation that you're feeling is sad but nice at the same time.. some people call it "frequent traveler symptom".. i always feel it when i return home..
                you want to be back in that place, with that people.. living those different and unique experiences that you've never experienced before.. but now you can
                look at your place with different eyes and understand it from different angles, you can valorate (valorate?? jaja) things that before where common..
                now you feel more than before from heart, you discovered new colors..
                <br>
                now your heart is not only from the us, now your heart expanded to all the world... or to argentina as a beginning.. when you travel you see that countries don't exist really..
                that we're all the same, with different cultures, different ways of thinking and doing things, but in the end, we're all humans.. we're all made of stars.. and we all feel equaly
                and you begin to love the human race in it's totallity.. I hope this experience was positive for you and your future steps, we didn't have the posibility to share more than a few words,
                but we shared something that don't need words, and that is music and it's energy that unifies people.. it was a pleasure to know you and i hope that someday, here, in colorado, or in shangai..
                we have the oportunity to meet again..don't be sad that you're home again, be happy because of what you lived, and more happy because you know that feeling now.. that is called freedom, that brings happiness..
                Life has just began, the best for u!! cheers!!"
